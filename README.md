CareBridge: A collaborative platform developed by a team of four, designed to connect midwives and mothers, facilitating efficient maternal and newborn care management. This project provides a seamless, user-friendly interface for expectant mothers, healthcare providers, and caregivers to manage essential services. Key features include:

Midwife and Mother Profiles: Personal profiles to manage care and ensure customized support.

Newborn Management: Track newborn health, vaccinations, and milestones.

Vaccination Records: Easily manage vaccination schedules with reminders.

Data Visualization: Clear and informative health data displays.

Admin Dashboard: A centralized interface for healthcare providers to oversee patients and services.

Developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), this platform enables real-time communication, secure data storage, and a smooth, interactive user experience. The project is a joint effort by a dedicated team focused on improving maternal and child healthcare.
